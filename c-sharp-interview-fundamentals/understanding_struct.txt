UNDERSTANDING STRUCT.

A struct is very similar to a class.
	it looks and acts like a class.
	But it is a value type, not a reference type. 

Structs share many functionalities of classes.
	Fields, properties, methods, andevents.
	Can implement interfaces.
	Instantiated with the 'new' keyword.

How structs are different from classes.
	Cannot delcare a default constructor. (constructor with no parameters)
	Cannot inheir from  another struct or class.
	Can be instantiated without the new keyword, bu there is no constructor call and all fields must be initialized before the object can be used.
