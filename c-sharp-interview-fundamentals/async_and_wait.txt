What's the difference between synchronous and asynchronous processing?
This is synchronous processing:
Man walks into bar, orders a drink, waits, gets drink, calss home.
This is asynchronous processing:
Man walks into bar, orders a drink, calls home while bartender prepares the drink.

Computers are designed to carry out actions synchronously.
Complete ask A, the complete task B.
Asynchronous processing makes this more efficient.
Task A runs on the main thread and Task B runs on a seperate thread at the same Time as Task A.

Programming asynchronously is challenging.
C#5 introduced two keywords to simplified asynchronous processing. async and wait.
Async is used to mark a method to inform the compiler to look for the await keyword.
The Await keyword tells the compiler that the async method can't continue past that point until the awaited asynchronous process is completed.
In the meantime, control returns to the caller of the Async method.
Async caller method and Await method run simultaneously.
