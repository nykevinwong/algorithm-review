UNDERSTANDING STATIC.
	The static modifier changes the behavior of C# types and members.
What's the difference?
	A static class or member cannot be accsseed through an instance.
	Classes and members can be marked as static.
	In a static class, all methodes must be marked as static.
A non-static class is used to create multiple objects based on the non-static type.
	Objects are created using the new keyword.
you cannot use the new keyword with a static class.
	Only one instance of the object ever exists.
